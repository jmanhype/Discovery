In this file structure, there are separate Python files for each module and agent. You can keep your project organized and modular with this structure. The "utilities" folder contains additional files such as GUI, performance metrics, and world state management. The "main.py" file is where you will run the agent simulation.

This program is a simulation of multiple agents with diverse personalities, and it demonstrates the interaction between agents and their environment. These agents update their beliefs and collaborate to achieve goals, leveraging various modules like natural language processing, probabilistic reasoning, and reinforcement learning. The code is divided into three main scripts: agent.py, simulation.py, and theoryofmind.py.

1. agent.py: This script contains the `Agent` class, which represents an individual agent in the simulation. The agent has several modules for language understanding, probabilistic reasoning, and other cognitive behaviors. The agent's `act` method allows it to take actions in the environment and update its state.

2. simulation.py: This script contains the `Simulation` class that manages the overall execution of the simulation, including creating, updating, and visualizing the agents and the world state. The `execute` method is the main loop of the simulation, where agents interact and take actions based on user input and performance metrics.

3. theoryofmind.py: This script contains the `TheoryOfMind` class that provides a higher cognitive understanding of other agents by interpreting their actions and updating their beliefs about the agents. It also allows querying other agents, visualizing the evolution of beliefs, and updating belief confidences over time.

The simulation works in the following way:

1. Initialize the simulation with multiple agents.

2. In the main loop (execute method of Simulation class), update the simulation state by calling agents' act methods and update world state with these actions.

3. Listen to user input and handle it accordingly.

4. Keep updating the GUI, interacting with agents, and gathering performance metrics.

5. Iterate through these steps until the termination condition is met or the maximum number of ticks is reached.

Using this simulation, you can observe how various agents with different personalities learn, make decisions, and interact with each other in a dynamic environment, potentially providing insights into agent-based interaction and decision-making mechanisms.
